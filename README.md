COS30043 – Interface Design (Swinburne University)
High Distinction (85) 

This repository showcases my work for COS30043 – Interface Design at Swinburne University. The unit focused on the principles of user-centered design, usability, and interaction design. It involved hands-on work in wireframing, prototyping, accessibility, and user testing.

Most of the design and development work presented here was completed independently as part of my personal portfolio. The project reflects strong attention to UX/UI best practices, iterative design processes, and front-end implementation skills.
